# Vagabond Lab

## About Us

The Vagabond Lab, led by Dr. Michael VanElzakker at the Division of Neurotherapeutics, Harvard Medical School, investigates the role of neuroinflammation in neurological and psychiatric conditions. Using state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques—specifically dual PET-MRI and ultra-high field 7-Tesla MRI—we explore the intricate relationship between the immune system and the brain.

## Research Focus

Our research aims to describe the mechanisms by which neuroinflammation contributes to cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Key areas of focus include:

* **Neuroimmune Interactions:** Investigating how peripheral immune signals influence brain function.
* **Glial Cell Activation:** Examining the role of microglia and astrocytes in neuroinflammation.
* **Neuroimaging of Inflammation:** Developing and applying advanced PET-MRI techniques to visualize neuroinflammation in vivo.
* **Cognitive Dysfunction:** Studying neuroinflammation’s impact on cognition in conditions such as Long COVID and ME/CFS.
* **Biomarker Discovery:** Identifying peripheral biomarkers that indicate central nervous system inflammation.
* **Structural Brain Abnormalities:** Exploring brain changes associated with infection-related chronic diseases.
* **Cerebrospinal Fluid Dynamics:** Examining CSF flow and pressure in neurological conditions.
* **Autonomic Dysfunction:** Investigating brainstem involvement in autonomic control and chronic illness.

## Current Projects

**Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Dysfunction in Long COVID & ME/CFS**

Utilizing dual PET-MRI, this project measures neuroinflammation and its connection to cognitive performance in individuals with Long COVID and ME/CFS. Blood and saliva samples are also analyzed to investigate correlations between neuroinflammation and other disease markers.

**Ultra-High Resolution 7-Tesla Imaging of Structural Abnormalities and CSF Flow in Infection-Associated Chronic Disease**

This project leverages 7-Tesla MRI to study symptom mechanisms in Long COVID and ME/CFS patients. We focused on structural abnormalities (e.g., craniocervical instability), autonomic dysfunction, cerebrospinal fluid flow disruptions, brain blood flow irregularities, intracranial pressure markers, vagus nerve signaling dysregulation.

## Techniques and Resources

We employ a wide range of cutting-edge techniques, including:

* **Dual PET-MRI Neuroimaging:** Simultaneous assessment of neuroinflammation and brain function.
* **Ultra-High Field 7-Tesla MRI:** High-resolution imaging of structural and functional brain changes.
* **Cognitive Testing:** Standardized assessments to evaluate cognitive impairments.
* **Biomarker Analysis:** Blood and saliva testing for inflammatory markers and viral proteins.
* **Computational Modeling:** Advanced data analysis of neuroimaging and behavioral outcomes.
